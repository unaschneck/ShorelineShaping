% This code 
% u(z) = (u_star/k)*ln(z/z0) <- Law of the Wall (with 4/10 rule which says that the depth-averaged flow is aprox equal to the flow at 4/10 of the depth)
%   z = from z0 to H

%       z0 = D/30 <-- assume rough turbulence (constant z0)
%       z0 = kin_visc/(9*u_star) <-- smooth turbulence
