% This code considers the threshold for grain entrainment on Titan by the oscillatory action of waves with
% the inclusion of a wave friction factor (fw) scaling term for the Shields parameter:
%                tau = 1/2*rho*g*fw*u^2 
% The exact form for the wave friction factor is not settled so in this code I am considering a
% range of fw that encompasses both hydraulically rough and hydraulically smooth:
%                (1) Rough Bed: (Soulsby & Whitehouse 1997)
%                       fw = 0.00251.*exp(5.21.*(((um*T)./(4*pi.*(d50))).^-0.19));
%                (2) Rough Bed: (Jonsson 1963)
%                       fw = 0.0604./(log(30*del./d50))     
%                           where del is the thickness of the laminar sublayer (goes to infinity as the grain size becomes comprable to the sublayer thickness, i.e. theory breakdowns)
%                (3) Smooth Bed: (Jonsson 1953)
%                       fw = 2*((dyn_visc/(0.5*rho*um*d0))^0.5);
%                (4) Smooth bed: (Schlicting 1968)
%                       fw = (2*(((w*dyn_visc)/rho_s)^0.5))/um
% Here the waves are being produced by surface winds (0.4 m/s to 3.3 m/s) via energy conservation
% besides viscous dissipation [make_wave_COE] and then allowed to shoal [shoal_wave_COE] along a
% constant slope consistent with measurements made at Ontario Lacus (Hayes et al. 2010)
%--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
% External function requirements:
%   (1) make_wave_COE.m -- wind exchanges energy with liquid and produces waves that grow to
%   breaking
%   (2) shoal_wave_COE.m -- wave shoals along a constant slope and computes where the waves are
%   predicted to break
%   (3) figure_settings.m -- makes figures look nice (not strictly neccessary to make calculations)
%--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
% Code produces:
%   (1) Shields diagram (dimensionless grain diameter vs Shields parameter) for surface winds of 0.4
%   m/s
%   (2) Shields diagram (dimensionless grain diameter vs Shields parameter) for surface winds of 3.3
%   m/s
